      "summary": "This paper considers the robotic on-orbit servicing of a client satellite. We present an adaptive robotic system to perform two on-orbit tasks: client manipulation and jammed component dislodging (e.g., a solar panel). We use adaptive control due to the uncertainty of the client dynamics and the stiffness of the jammed component. We present two methods for dislodging: a decentralized approach with multiple free-fiying collaborating agents and then transferring the same decentralized approach to a multi-robot arms system. We present simulation studies for these on-orbit servicing tasks. These studies validate the effectiveness of the presented controller despite uncertainty and unmodeled dynamics, such as nonlinear friction."
