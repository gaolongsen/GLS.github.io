# **Fast Tune Tool When you Build up Your MuJoCo Environment**

When I build up a new MuJoCo environment or need to modify the environment based on the previous environment, especially I want to insert a new `body` or `geom` on a precise position and rotation , sometimes it's difficult because of the complexity of the high-DoF model. Here you can use the tool I support here to help you find your desired placement in quick.

**Preparations**: Please refer the `mujoco-py` setup in my previous blog through this **[link](https://longsengao.com/blog/2024/MuJoCo/)**.
