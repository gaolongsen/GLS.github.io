This project is based on an undergraduate national robot competition using biomimetic fish structure design for underwater robots. The aim is to use a robot to detect the leaking point of the tube underwater. We use STM32F407ZET6 embedded board and OpenCV camera module to incorporate the computer vision algorithm and PID controller for the robot fish to ensure it can swim under the water and detect all leaking pointspoints quickly.
