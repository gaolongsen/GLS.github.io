I'm now a third-year PhD student at AgMan Lab, University of New Mexico under the supervision of [Prof. Rafael Fierro](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=I7RhPnIAAAAJ&hl=en) and co-supervision of [Prof. Claus Danielson](https://www.unm.edu/~cdanielson/). Also, I'm now collaboratively working with CMU Robotics Institute leading by [Prof. Howie Choset](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/howie-choset/) and TAMU Laser Lab leading by [Prof. Manoranjan Majji](https://lasr.tamu.edu/team/) in space robotics filed.



My research interest focus on **high-DOF robotics manipulation**, **control system** and **machine learning**. Currently, I'm focusing on space servicing and repairing project leveraging multi-robot arm system and learning-based control algorithm. Besides, I'm passionate about vision-based grasping work and am now working on a vision-based pre-capturing project for free-flying space objects.
